        "h1_p": "Each number shows how many **consecutive** filled cells are in this row or column.",
        "h1_li1": "If there is a number <strong>5</strong> in a row, it means there is a block of five filled cells in it.",
        "h1_li2": "If there are several numbers, for example <strong>3 1</strong>, this means that in this row there is first a block of three cells, and then — a block of one.",
        "h1_li3": "<strong>Important:</strong> There must be at least one empty (unfilled) cell between two blocks of filled cells.",
        "h2_title": "2. Start with the obvious",
        "h2_p": "Look for rows or columns that can be filled immediately. For example, if the grid size is 10x10 and there is a 10 in a row — then the entire row will be filled.",
        "h3_title": "3. Place crosses",
        "h3_p": "If you are sure that a cell should be empty, place a <strong>cross (RMB)</strong> in it. This will help you cut off impossible options and find the correct solution faster.",
